when we have missing data on our code , like = n/a or null ( prob because somaone just forogt something or idk) , isnt good to throw away all their data just by one missing row or column.
one thing that we should do is see all the datatypes of each row / column 
df = pd.read_csv (url of the data)
df.head()  to sohw the first 5 rows
 we can change the number for parameters , just like this:
 df.columns = [
    'age'
    'years'
    etc...
 ]
 and the we can use df.dtypes ( to see the type of data of the matrix)




 obs : get_dummies and ColumnTransformer to transform values to numbers ( + xCOLUMNS , x being the number of diferent previous values)
